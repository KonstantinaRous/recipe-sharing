  "description": "Build a Recipe Sharing Website The idea is to build a website where users can share their favorite recipes. Here are some suggested features: Front-end: * A homepage that displays the most popular recipes or the latest recipes added * A search bar to allow users to search for recipes by keyword or ingredient * A page for each recipe that displays the ingredients, instructions, and photos * A page for each user that displays the recipes they have added and their profile information * A form for users to add new recipes, including fields for the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, and photo upload * A form for users to edit or delete their recipes * A responsive design that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices",

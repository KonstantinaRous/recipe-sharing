Build a Recipe Sharing Website
The idea is to build a website where users can share their favorite recipes. Here are some suggested features:
Front-end:
* A homepage that displays the most popular recipes or the latest recipes added
* A search bar to allow users to search for recipes by keyword or ingredient
* A page for each recipe that displays the ingredients, instructions, and photos
* A page for each user that displays the recipes they have added and their profile information
* A form for users to add new recipes, including fields for the recipe name, ingredients, instructions, and photo upload
* A form for users to edit or delete their recipes
* A responsive design that looks good on both desktop and mobile devices
Back-end:
* A database to store recipe data, user data, and authentication information
* An API to allow the front-end to interact with the database
* Authentication and authorization to ensure that only registered users can add or edit recipes
* Implementation of design patterns such as MVC, Singleton, Factory, and Observer to improve the application's structure, maintainability, and scalability
* Integration of third-party libraries and frameworks such as Express, Mongoose, and React
